# Django_Contact_box

My first django application which is contact box, using:
- Python
- Django
- MySQL
- HTML
 
Application allows easily contact administration:
add, delete or modify contact, add new group, add person to an existing group of people.

On this level I didn't use templates, but my second django project (Django preschool management) uses templates engine.
